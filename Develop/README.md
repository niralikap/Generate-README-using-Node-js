## Description
This project generates a README.md file by using command line application. It takes the input from the user using the array of questions in the index.js file. It then writes it to a new ReadMe file created with the framework provided in another js file. 

## Installation
We need to install the node modules and package-lock.json using npm install command for the code to run.

## Usage
Generating a README file using a command line application allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.

## Contributing
The project is available on Github in a public repository. The contributors can fork the repository and make changes or create a branch to push the changes with approval.

## Test Cases
1. Verify the application runs successfully using node index.js command and that the users are prompted with the questions.          2. Verify the README.md file is generated and that the framework along with the answers are displayed in the file.            3. Verify the preview mode can be opened and viewed successfully.                 4. Verify the license badge is generated on the top of the file.                  5. Verify the link to the license badge is routing to the correct URL.                       6. Verify the link to GitHub is routing to the Github repository.                    7.

# 09 Node.js Challenge: Professional README Generator

## User Story

AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

## Description

In this assignment, I have created a Professional README.md file using the command line application- Node.js. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.

The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js

In order to run the application successfully, we need to run the command "npm install" to install the node modules and package-lock.json. This application also contains the gitignore file.

The application does the following:

- This application that accepts user input 
- When I am prompted for information about my application repository, then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions

- When I enter my project title, then this is displayed as the title of the README

- When I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, then this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests

- When I choose a license for my application from a list of options, then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under

- When I enter my GitHub username, then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile

- When I enter my email address, then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions

- When I click on the links in the Table of Contents, then I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
